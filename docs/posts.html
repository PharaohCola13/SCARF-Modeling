		Found NASA reports relating to the electrical properties of lunar rocks and soil, as well as research defining
        the relationship between temperature and ground conductivity. There was also articles detailing the atmospheric
        properties of the moon that shed light on how to develop the profile. It appears that even through the moon's
        atmosphere is incredibility thin, it is primarily composed of Sodium, Potassium, Helium, and Argon gas.
        It was also mentioned that the Solar Weather interactions could alter the electrical properties of the surface
        since this weather is composed of ionized particles that produce magnetic fields. I am looking to now verify that
        a ground conductivity of 0.0001 S/m and a dielectric constant of 3 are appropriate parameters for the lunar surface.

		Found Sounding data for Mars and Titan. Found some resources discussing the climate models associated with
		Venus, Mars, and Titan. Found another resource related to the calculation of path loss, it appears as
		though I was originally missing some terms when calculating the path loss for a signal. I have also
		added the option to view sounding data in the SCARF Dashboard that will be the interface for the
		model.There is still a substantial amount of research and development to work on. I will most likely
		organize all of the attached resources on the projects website
		<a href="index.html">https://pharaohcola13.github.io/SCARF-Modeling/</a>.

	<p>Found resources related to the impact of external magnetic fields
		and the dielectric properties of a surface, and atmospheric
		modeling for two planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system. The NASA
		report regarding RF modeling on the moon used Meteor Crater as a terrain model.

		Was able to locate NASA research on the application of ITM models on the lunar surface.
	</p>
	<b>Lunar Approximations</b>
	<ol>
		<li>Ground Conductivity was approximated to be 0.0001 S/m</li>
		<li>The Dielectric constant was approximated to be 3.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		The comparison between the Longley-Rice, ITM, and ITWOM yielded results that favored the
		ITWOM model at distances <20 km. It was noted that the ITM model did not do so well in
		terms of line of sight measurements compared to the alternate models.
