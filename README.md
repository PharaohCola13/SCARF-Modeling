# Planetary RF Propagation Modeling
## SCARF Modeling (Surface-Climate Ambiguity in Radio Frequency Modeling)

[Updates on Project](https://www.researchgate.net/project/Planetary-RF-Propagation-Modeling)

### Goal: Develop a generalized model of RF propagation to use on other planets

### Expected testing locations in order of difficulty
1. Moon
2. Mars
3. Titan
4. TRAPPIST-1g

### Important Constants (Dependent on the location)
* Mean Radius of planet/moon
* Dielectric Constant
* Ground Conductivity

### Important Variables (Dependent on the location)
* Atmospheric density
* Contents of Atmosphere
* Climate patterns
* Electromagnetic Interactions with other objects

### Important Questions
1. Does the evolution of an objects magnetic field impact the propagation system?

### Tools
1. [SPLAT!](https://www.qsl.net/kd2bd/splat.html)
