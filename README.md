# SCARF Modeling 
#### (Surface-Climate Ambiguity in Radio Frequency Modeling)

[Updates on Project](https://pharaohcola13.github.io/SCARF-Modeling/posts)

## Goal
To develop a generalized model of radio propagation that takes into account variations of atmospheric and 
astrophysical phenomena through the use of profiles. The interface for the model will have the capabilities 
to import the profiles and make a variety of calculations and analyze data regarding radio propagation on 
any planet or moon, anywhere. The interface for this model will have substantial overlap with SPLAT!, but 
will allow a wider variety of inputs for a wider range of analysis.

## Methodology
To achieve the Goal, there must be an understanding of the impacts of magnetic field interactions in relation 
with solar and atmospheric climate, the dielectric properties of the surface, etc. Thus, there are four 
locations that will be examined, each a laboratory for a different property.

The Moon will be examined because of it's exposure to solar winds and the magnetic field interactions with Earth. 
Mars will be examined for it's atmospheric properties as well as the impact of solar weather on the surface, 
since Mars does not have a internally generated magnetic field, yet still possesses an atmosphere. T
itan will be studied for its atmospheric/geological properties and for the electromagnetic interactions with Saturn. 
The TRAPPIST-1 planet will provide insight into the impact of stellar activity of the Red Dwarf star has on the 
climate of the planet, if there is any.

Each of these laboratories will have a data file describing the atmospheric and astrophysical properties for the 
planet or moon, an example profile can be found [here](https://pharaohcola13.github.io/SCARF-Modeling/exmaple.ecp). 
(It should be noted that the contents of the profiles are 
subject to change as the project continues.) The profiles will then be uploaded into the SCARF Dashboard for 
development and testing of the dashboard. All data files and resources will be posted on this site.
